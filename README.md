# The Coral Reef Crisis - ModelIt! Interactive Story

An interactive choose-your-own-adventure game teaching Boolean modeling concepts through marine biology.

## Story Overview

**Character:** Dr. Kai - Pacific Islander marine biologist
- Warm, curious, passionate about ocean conservation
- Based at underwater research station "Reef Haven"

**Mystery:** The coral reef is dying in mysterious patterns. Dr. Kai discovers strange bleaching that defies normal explanations. Players must help build a model of the reef ecosystem to understand the cascade of failures.

## Chapter Outline

| Chapter | Modeling Concept | Story Beat |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| 0 | What is a Model? | Dr. Kai introduces reef research station |
| 1 | Components/Species | Identify reef inhabitants (coral, fish, algae, predators) |
| 2 | Relationships | Map who eats whom, symbiosis (coral-zooxanthellae) |
| 3 | **BOSS 1:** Initial Conditions | Healthy reef baseline state |
| 4 | Logic Functions | Temperature + acidity triggers for bleaching |
| 5 | State Space | All possible reef health states |
| 6 | **BOSS 2:** Feedback Loops | Cascade: bleaching -> fish leave -> algae bloom |
| 7 | Predicting Behavior | Model predicts reef collapse timeline |
| 8 | Perturbations | Test: what if we reduce pollution? |
| 9 | **FINAL BOSS:** Validation | Compare model to actual reef recovery data |
| 10 | Iteration | Refine model, propose conservation plan |

## Visual Style

- Vibrant underwater blues, teals, corals
- Bioluminescent accents
- Marine life (fish, sharks, sea turtles, octopi)
- Cartoon anime art style (consistent with Dr. Maya from modelit-mystery)
